    "This week we'll talk about advanced network measures (beyond the degree distribution). We will use these tools to make sense of the network of the Comics Characters on Wikipedia. \n",
    "This is the outline for today:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visualization and qualitative analysis of the Comic Book Characters Network\n",
    "* Properties of the network structure, including how univere-origin and other properties shape the network\n",

    "> _Reading_: This week, the reading is mostly for reference. It's for you to have a place to go, if you want more detailed information about the topics that I cover in the video lectures. Thus, I recommend you check out **Chapter 9** of the network science book. In particular, we'll delve into [Section 9.4](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/9#modularity) in the exercises below. We will also talk a little bit about degree correlations - you can read about those in [Chapter 7](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/7)\\."

    ">1. Use NetworkX `DiGraph` to store the network of characters. Remember that characters are linked if they have a corresponding link between their Wikipedia pages. \n",
    ">   * **Additionally**, extract the largest component - it will make our work with visualisations much easier (note: removing *isolated* nodes (with no links) does not guarantee that you are left with the largest component).\n",
    ">     - *Note 1*: You probably have the right graph if you have more than 2k nodes and more than 15k edges.\n",
    ">     - *Note 2*: For directed graphs use `weakly connected component` to extract the largest component.\n",
    ">     - *Note 3*: Further analysis is done with the largest component\n",
    ">2. As you build the graph, store the attributes of the nodes (remember the `universe` from the past week). On top of that, let's also store the `length of the content` as one of the attributes of the node (i.e. count the number of *words* you have in each character's page). By storing this information as nodal features, we keep all the relevant data in one place. The safe way to count words without counting symbols is to use `regex`, but simpler methods are OK."

If an edge connects two nodes from Marvel universe assign `color_a`, if the edge connects two nodes from DC universe assign `color_b`, in case a link connects nodes from disparate universes, cases assign `color_c`. (Here, you get to decide on the colors.)"

    ">    * Some long time ago, couple of scientist have analyzed the network that is spanned by the whole Wikipedia (paper is called [Wikipedias: Collaborative web-based encyclopedias as complex networks](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.74.016115); to access this paper, use findit.dtu.dk or read the preprint on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0602149)). Do your findings correspond to the results described in Chapter **III.A** of that paper? If not, try to give your explanation of why? \n",

    ">4. Plot a heatmap [(Hint here)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2369492/generate-a-heatmap-in-matplotlib-using-a-scatter-data-set) of the the in- versus out- degree for all characters. What is the advantage of using a heatmap over the scatter plot?\n",
    ">5. Why do you think I want you guys to use a directed graph? Are there questions we can ask using the directed graph that are not possible to answer in the undirected version. Which questions? Can you think of examples when the in/out distinction doesn't matter.\n",
    ">6. We have one more metric that we did not use. The node-attribute `content lenght`. There are two things we can investigate here.\n",
    ">   * Firstly, we can verify that more text means more links. If that's true the length should correlate with out-degree. Does it? \n",
    ">   * Secondly, and more interestingly, it could be that longer texts means *more famous* characters. And that means more in-links. \n",
    ">   * How should you test this? Well, here you are allowed to be **creative**. You may choose the method of your liking to study this question (e.g. look at it visually, test the correlation using [spearman](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.spearmanr.html) or [pearson](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.pearsonr.html) correlations, fit a curve to the data, you decide). Once you've tested, let me know. Are both questions true? If yes, which phenomenon is stronger? Explain your results in your own words"
