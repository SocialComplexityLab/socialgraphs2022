    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Binning real numbers\n",
    "  * Let's do a gentle start and use the `random` library generate 5000 data points from a Gaussian distribution with $\\mu = 2$ and $\\sigma = 0.125$.\n",
    "  * Now, let's use `numpy.histogram` to bin those number into 10 bins. What does the `numpy.histogram` function return? Do the two arrays have the same length?\n",
    "  * Then we use `matplotlib.pyplot.plot` to plot the binned data. You will have to deal with the fact that the counts- and bin-arrays have different lengths. Explain how you deal with this problem and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Binning integers\n",
    "  * But binning real numbers into a fixed number of bins is easy when `numpy.histogram` does all the work and finds the right bin boundaries for you. \n",
    "Now we'll generate a bunch of integers and set the bin boundaries manually. This time, let's grab data from a Poisson distribution. As it turns out `numpy` also has some convenient random number generators. Use `numpy.random.poisson` to generate 5000 numbers drawn from a Poisson distribution characterized by $\\lambda = 10$. Find the maximum and minimum value of your 5000 random numbers. \n",
    "  * Instead of simplify specifying the number of bins for `numpy.histogram`, let's specify the bins we want using a vector. Create a vector $v$ that results in a binning that puts each integer value in its own bin and where the first bin contains the minimum number you found above, and the last bin contains the maximum number (you may want to think about how `numpy.histogram` deals with the smallest an largest value in particular; is it correct to set the first entry of $v$ to be equal to the smallest value you observe and the last entry of $v$ to be the highest value observed?). Use the vector by setting `numpy.histogram`'s `bin` parameter as `bin = ` $v$. What is the sum over bin counts? Explain how the binning-vectors first and last element relates to the min and max from the Poisson distribution.\n",
    "  * Now, use a bar chart (`matplotlib.pyplot.bar`) to plot the distribution \n",
    "  \n",
    "C. Binning and plotting degree distributions. \n",
    "  * Let's generate the Erdös-Renyi (ER) network which has a degree distribution that matches the Poisson distribution above. \n",
    "First we have to figure out which values the ER parameters (_N_ and _p_) should assume. It's easy to see that $N = 5000$, but how do you find $p$? \n",
    "**Hint**: The parameter $\\lambda$ in the Poisson distribution corresponds to the average degree, so you have to find a $p$ that results in an average degree, $k = 10$. And you know that $\\langle k \\rangle = p (N-1)$, which will give you $p$.\n",
    "  * Now, use `networkx` to create the graph and extract the degree distribution.\n",
    "  * Finally, create a nice bar plot of the degree distribution, including axes labels and a plot title. Make sure that it looks like the Poisson distribution you plotted above."

    "# Part 5. Power-laws and the friendship paradox\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step is to explore the [Friendship paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship_paradox). This paradox states that _almost everyone_ has fewer friends than their friends have, on average\\*. This sounds crazy, but is actually an almost trivial consequence of living in a social network with a power-law degree distribution. The explanation is that almost everyone is friends with a hub, that drives up the average degree of the friends. Let's explore that in the 5000 node BA network we've just generated (let's call this network **F-BA** for *friendship BA*). Do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "A. The friendship paradox in BA networks\n",
    "* Pick a node $i$ at random (e.g. use `random.choice`). [Find its degree](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/classes/generated/networkx.Graph.degree.html).\n",
    "* Find $i$'s [neighbors](https://networkx.github.io/documentation/networkx-1.10/reference/generated/networkx.Graph.neighbors.html?highlight=neighbors#networkx.Graph.neighbors). And calculate their average degree.\n",
    "* Compare the two numbers to check if it's true that $i$'s friends (on average) have more friends than $i$.\n",
    "* Do this 1000 times. How many out of those 1000 times is the friendship paradox true in **F-BA**?\n",
    "\n",
    "B. The friendship paradox more generally\n",
    "* What if the power law is flatter, e.g. $p(k) \\sim k^{-\\gamma}$ with $\\gamma = 1.5$? Will the fraction of times the paradox is true be higher or lower? \n",
    " - First answer this question by simply reasoning. Think about what it would mean in terms of hubs that the power law is flatter?\n",
    " - Now simulate a new network with the slope mentioned above. You can generate networks with power-law degree distributions using the [configuation model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_model). The `networkx` funtion is here [`nx.configuration_model`](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.degree_seq.configuration_model.html). I suggest you make the network pretty big ... let's say 5000 nodes or more.\n",
    "    * Hint 0: In the `networkx` function mentioned above, you need a degree sequence. This can be created using the so-called transformation method. If we can generate a random real number $r$ uniformly distributed in the range $0 \\leq r < 1$, then $x = x_{\\textrm{min}}(1 – r)^{-1/\\alpha - 1}$ is a random power-law-distributed real number in the range $x_{\\textrm{min}} \\leq x < \\infty$ with exponent $\\alpha$. Note that there has to be a lower limit $x_\\textrm{min}$ on the range; the power-law distribution diverges as $x\\rightarrow 0$. See [this paper](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6241/2019sp/readings/Newman-2005-distributions.pdf) for more details.\n",
    "    * Hint 1: The sequence generated using the method mentioned above consists of real numbers, we need integers, so it needs to be rounded as well.\n",
    "    * Hint 2: Also, due to some details of how the configuation works (see the [wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_model) for details), the sequence cannot have a sum which is an odd number, so if your sequence turns out odd, just choose an element and add 1 to its degree, that way the sum will be an even number.\n",
    "- Did you reason correctly above? For what fraction of the time is the friendship paradox true for your network with a new slope?\n",
    "- Now generate a network for the configuration model that has *the same slope and number of nodes as **F-BA** in 5.A above*; let's call this new network **F-CM** (for *friendship configuration model*). \n",
    "   - What fraction of the time is the friendship paradox is true for the **F-CM** network?\n",
    "   - Assuming that **F-BA** and **F-CM** have the same degree sequence can now *think* about if **F-BA** and **F-CM** are different with respect to the friendship paradox. Specifically, please explain your thoughts on the following topics\n",
    "      * Are there factors beyond the degree-distribution that could impact how frequently the friendship paradox is true? I might consider how network properties like assortativity, clustering, community-structure, etc potentially could impact things (it's OK to search online and add references to your answer).\n",
    "      * How would you test more rigorously if the friendship-paradox is actually true equally often in **F-BA** and **F-CM**? (E.g. how would you run a statistical test to investigate ... or how would you put error-bars on your plots?)"
