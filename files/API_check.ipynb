His contributions to art came in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the [[Dutch Golden Age]], when Dutch art (especially [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch painting]]), although in many ways antithetical to the [[Baroque|Baroque style]] that dominated Europe, was extremely prolific and innovative and gave rise to important new genres. Like many artists of the Dutch Golden Age, such as [[Jan Vermeer]] of Delft, Rembrandt was also an avid [[art collector]] and [[art dealer|dealer]].\\n\\nRembrandt never went abroad, but he was considerably influenced by the work of the [[Italian masters]] and [[Netherlandish art]]ists who had studied in Italy, like [[Pieter Lastman]], the [[Utrecht Caravaggists]], [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]], and [[Peter Paul Rubens]]. After he achieved youthful success as a portrait painter, Rembrandt\\'s later years were marked by personal tragedy and financial hardships. Yet his etchings and paintings were popular throughout his lifetime, his reputation as an artist remained high,<ref>Gombrich, p. 427.</ref> and for twenty years he taught many important Dutch painters.<ref name=\"Clark_203\">{{Harvnb|Clark|1969|pp=203}}</ref>\\n\\nRembrandt\\'s portraits of his contemporaries, self-portraits and illustrations of scenes from the Bible are regarded as his greatest creative triumphs. [[Self-portraits by Rembrandt|His self-portraits]] form a unique and intimate autobiography, in which the artist surveyed himself without vanity and with the utmost sincerity.<ref name=\"Gombrich, p. 420\" /> Rembrandt\\'s foremost contribution in the history of printmaking was his transformation of the etching process from a relatively new reproductive technique into a true [[art form]], along with [[Jacques Callot]]. His reputation as the greatest [[etcher]] in the history of the medium was established in his lifetime and never questioned since. Few of [[List of paintings by Rembrandt|his paintings]] left the [[Dutch Republic]] while he lived, but his [[old master prints|prints]] were circulated throughout Europe, and his wider reputation was initially based on them alone.\\n[[File:Rembrandt - Rembrandt and Saskia in the Scene of the Prodigal Son - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|\\'\\'[[The Prodigal Son in the Tavern]]\\'\\', a self-portrait with Saskia, c. 1635]]\\n\\nIn his works he exhibited knowledge of classical [[iconography]], which he molded to fit the requirements of his own experience; thus, the depiction of a biblical scene was informed by Rembrandt\\'s knowledge of the specific text, his assimilation of classical composition, and his observations of [[Amsterdam]]\\'s [[Jewish Amsterdam|Jewish population]].<ref name=\"Clark_203_204\">{{Harvnb|Clark|1969|pp=203–204}}</ref> Because of his empathy for the human condition, he has been called \"one of the great prophets of civilization\".<ref name=\"Clark_205\">{{Harvnb|Clark|1969|pp=205}}</ref> The French sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]] said, \"Compare me with Rembrandt!

Until then, he had signed with a combination of initials or monograms. In late 1632, he began signing solely with his first name, \"Rembrant\". He added the \"d\" in the following year and stuck to this spelling for the rest of his life. Although scholars can only speculate, this change must have had a meaning for Rembrandt, which is generally interpreted as his wanting to be known by his first name like the great figures of the Italian Renaissance: Leonardo, Raphael etc., who did not sign with their last names, if at all.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rembrandt-signature-file.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409172243/http://www.rembrandt-signature-file.com/|title=Rembrandt Signature Files|archive-date=9 April 2016|website=www.rembrandt-signature-file.com}}</ref>}} Harmenszoon van Rijn was born on 15 July 1606 in [[Leiden]],<ref name=\"BY\" /> in the [[Dutch Republic]], now the [[Netherlands]].

In 1639 they moved to a prominent newly built house (now the [[Rembrandt House Museum]]) in the upscale \\'Breestraat\\' (eng.: \\'Broadway\\'), today known as [[Jodenbreestraat]] in what was becoming the Jewish quarter; then a young upcoming neighborhood. The [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] to finance the 13,000 [[guilder]] purchase would be a primary cause for later financial difficulties.<ref name=Bull-28/> Rembrandt should easily have been able to pay the house off with his large income, but it appears his spending always kept pace with his income, and he may have made some unsuccessful investments.<ref>Clark, 1978, pp. 26–27, 76, 102</ref> It was there that Rembrandt frequently sought his Jewish neighbors to model for his [[Old Testament]] scenes.<ref>Adams, p. 660</ref> Although they were by now affluent, the couple suffered several personal setbacks; their son Rumbartus died two months after his birth in 1635 and their daughter Cornelia died at just three weeks of age in 1638. In 1640, they had a second daughter, also named Cornelia, who died after living barely over a month. Only their fourth child, [[Titus van Rijn|Titus]], who was born in 1641, survived into adulthood. Saskia died in 1642 soon after Titus\\'s birth, probably from [[tuberculosis]]. Rembrandt\\'s drawings of her on her sick and death bed are among his most moving works.<ref name=\"Slive-71\">Slive, p. 71</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Rembrandt van Rijn - Rembrandts zoon Titus in monniksdracht (Rijksmuseum Amsterdam).jpg|thumb|Rembrandt\\'s son [[Titus as a Monk|Titus, as a monk]], 1660]]\\n\\nDuring Saskia\\'s illness, [[Geertje Dircx]] was hired as Titus\\' caretaker and nurse and also became Rembrandt\\'s lover.

In 1654 they had a daughter, Cornelia, bringing Hendrickje a summons from the [[Dutch Reformed Church|Reformed Church]] to answer the charge \"that she had committed the acts of a whore with Rembrandt the painter\". She admitted this and was banned from receiving communion. Rembrandt was not summoned to appear for the Church council because he was not a member of the Reformed Church.<ref>Slive, p. 82</ref> The two were considered legally wed under common law, but Rembrandt had not married Hendrickje. Had he remarried he would have lost access to a trust set up for Titus in Saskia\\'s will.<ref name=Slive-71/>\\n\\nRembrandt lived beyond his means, buying art (including bidding up his own work), prints (often used in his paintings) and rarities, which probably caused a court arrangement to avoid his bankruptcy in 1656, by selling most of his paintings and large collection of antiquities. The sale list survives and gives a good insight into Rembrandt\\'s collections, which, apart from [[Old Master]] paintings and drawings, included busts of the Roman emperors, suits of Japanese armor among many objects from Asia, and collections of natural history and minerals.  But the prices realized in the sales in 1657 and 1658 were disappointing.<ref>Slive, p. 84</ref> Rembrandt was forced to sell his house and his printing-press and move to more modest accommodation on the [[Rozengracht]] in 1660.<ref>Schwartz, p. 12. The house sale was in 1658, but was agreed with two years for Rembrandt to vacate.</ref> The authorities and his creditors were generally accommodating to him, except for the Amsterdam [[painters\\' guild]], which introduced a new rule that no one in Rembrandt\\'s circumstances could trade as a painter. To get around this, Hendrickje and Titus set up a [[dummy corporation]] as art dealers in 1660, with Rembrandt as an employee.<ref>Clark, 1974 p. 105</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Rembrandt Memorial Marker Westerkerk Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|Rembrandt Memorial Marker Westerkerk Amsterdam]]\\n\\nIn 1661 Rembrandt (or rather the new business) was contracted to complete work for the newly built city hall, but only after Govert Flinck, the artist previously commissioned, died without beginning to paint.

Durham suggests that this was because the Bible was for Rembrandt \"a kind of diary, an account of moments in his own life\".<ref>Durham, p. 60.</ref>\\n\\nAmong the more prominent characteristics of Rembrandt\\'s work are his use of [[chiaroscuro]], the theatrical employment of light and shadow derived from [[Caravaggio]], or, more likely, from the Dutch [[Utrecht Caravaggism|Caravaggisti]], but adapted for very personal means.<ref>Bull, et al., pp. 11–13.</ref> Also notable are his dramatic and lively presentation of subjects, devoid of the rigid formality that his contemporaries often displayed, and a deeply felt compassion for mankind, irrespective of wealth and age. His immediate family—his wife Saskia, his son Titus and his common-law wife Hendrickje—often figured prominently in his paintings, many of which had [[mythology|mythical]], biblical or historical themes.\\n\\n===Periods, themes and styles===\\nThroughout his career Rembrandt took as his primary subjects the themes of portraiture, landscape and narrative painting. For the last, he was especially praised by his contemporaries, who extolled him as a masterly interpreter of biblical stories for his skill in representing emotions and attention to detail.<ref>van der Wetering, p. 268.</ref> Stylistically, his paintings progressed from the early \"smooth\" manner, characterized by fine technique in the portrayal of illusionistic form, to the late \"rough\" treatment of richly variegated paint surfaces, which allowed for an illusionism of form suggested by the tactile quality of the paint itself.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 160, 190.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn - The Abduction of Europa - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Abduction of Europa (Rembrandt)|\\'\\'The Abduction of Europa\\'\\']], 1632.

In the etchings of his maturity, particularly from the late 1640s onward, the freedom and breadth of his drawings and paintings found expression in the print medium as well.

Often these landscapes highlighted natural drama, featuring uprooted trees and ominous skies (\\'\\'Cottages before a Stormy Sky\\'\\', c.&nbsp;1641; \\'\\'The Three Trees\\'\\', 1643). From 1640 his work became less exuberant and more sober in tone, possibly reflecting personal tragedy. Biblical scenes were now derived more often from the [[New Testament]] than the [[Old Testament]], as had been the case before. In 1642 he painted \\'\\'[[The Night Watch]]\\'\\', the most substantial of the important group portrait commissions which he received in this period, and through which he sought to find solutions to compositional and narrative problems that had been attempted in previous works.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 288.</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Rembrandt - Zelfportret - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|upright|\\'\\'Self Portrait\\'\\', 1658, [[Frick Collection]], a masterpiece of the final style, \"the calmest and grandest of all his portraits\"<ref>Clark 1978, p. 28</ref>]]\\n\\nIn the decade following the \\'\\'Night Watch\\'\\', Rembrandt\\'s paintings varied greatly in size, subject, and style. The previous tendency to create dramatic effects primarily by strong contrasts of light and shadow gave way to the use of frontal lighting and larger and more saturated areas of color. Simultaneously, figures came to be placed parallel to the picture plane. These changes can be seen as a move toward a classical mode of composition and, considering the more expressive use of brushwork as well, may indicate a familiarity with Venetian art (\\'\\'Susanna and the Elders\\'\\', 1637–47).<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 163–65.</ref>\\nAt the same time, there was a marked decrease in painted works in favor of etchings and drawings of landscapes.<ref>van de Wetering, p. 289.</ref> In these graphic works natural drama eventually made way for quiet Dutch rural scenes.\\n\\nIn the 1650s, Rembrandt\\'s style changed again. Colors became richer and brush strokes more pronounced. With these changes, Rembrandt distanced himself from earlier work and current fashion, which increasingly inclined toward fine, detailed works. His use of light becomes more jagged and harsh, and shine becomes almost nonexistent. His singular approach to paint application may have been suggested in part by familiarity with the work of [[Titian]], and could be seen in the context of the then current discussion of \\'finish\\' and surface quality of paintings. Contemporary accounts sometimes remark disapprovingly of the coarseness of Rembrandt\\'s brushwork, and the artist himself was said to have dissuaded visitors from looking too closely at his paintings.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 155–65.</ref> The tactile manipulation of paint may hearken to medieval procedures, when mimetic effects of rendering informed a painting\\'s surface. The end result is a richly varied handling of paint, deeply layered and often apparently haphazard, which suggests form and space in both an illusory and highly individual manner.<ref>van de Wetering, pp. 157–58, 190.</ref>\\n\\nIn later years biblical themes were still depicted often, but emphasis shifted from dramatic group scenes to intimate portrait-like figures (\\'\\'James the Apostle\\'\\', 1661). In his last years, Rembrandt painted his most deeply reflective self-portraits (from 1652 to 1669 he painted fifteen), and several moving images of both men and women (\\'\\'[[The Jewish Bride]]\\'\\', c.&nbsp;1666)—in love, in life, and before God.<ref>\"In Rembrandt\\'s (late) great portraits we feel face to face with real people, we sense their warmth, their need for sympathy and also their loneliness and suffering.

Only the troubled year of 1649 produced no dated work.<ref>Schwartz, 1994, pp. 8–12</ref> He took easily to etching and, though he also learned to use a [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] and partly [[engraving|engraved]] many plates, the freedom of etching technique was fundamental to his work. He was very closely involved in the whole process of printmaking, and must have printed at least early examples of his etchings himself. At first he used a style based on drawing, but soon moved to one based on painting, using a mass of lines and numerous bitings with the acid to achieve different strengths of line. Towards the end of the 1630s, he reacted against this manner and moved to a simpler style, with fewer bitings.<ref>White 1969, pp. 5–6</ref> He worked on the so-called \\'\\'[[Hundred Guilder Print]]\\'\\' in stages throughout the 1640s, and it was the \"critical work in the middle of his career\", from which his final etching style began to emerge.<ref>White 1969, p. 6</ref>\\nAlthough the print only survives in two [[state (printmaking)|states]], the first very rare, evidence of much reworking can be seen underneath the final print and many drawings survive for elements of it.<ref>White 1969, pp. 6, 9–10</ref>\\n\\n[[File:Die landschaft mit den drei baeumen.jpg|thumb|left|\\'\\'The Three Trees\\'\\', 1643, etching]]\\n\\nIn the mature works of the 1650s, Rembrandt was more ready to improvise on the plate and large prints typically survive in several states, up to eleven, often radically changed. He now used [[hatching]] to create his dark areas, which often take up much of the plate. He also experimented with the effects of printing on different kinds of paper, including [[Japanese paper]], which he used frequently, and on [[vellum]]. He began to use \"[[surface tone]],\" leaving a thin film of ink on parts of the plate instead of wiping it completely clean to print each impression. He made more use of [[drypoint]], exploiting, especially in landscapes, the rich fuzzy burr that this technique gives to the first few impressions.<ref>White, 1969 pp. 6–7</ref>\\n\\nHis prints have similar subjects to his paintings, although the twenty-seven self-portraits are relatively more common, and portraits of other people less so. There are forty-six landscapes, mostly small, which largely set the course for the graphic treatment of landscape until the end of the 19th century. One third of his etchings are of religious subjects, many treated with a homely simplicity, whilst others are his most monumental prints. A few erotic, or just obscene, compositions have no equivalent in his paintings.<ref>See Schwartz, 1994, where the works are divided by subject, following [[Adam Bartsch|Bartsch]].</ref> He owned, until forced to sell it, a magnificent collection of prints by other artists, and many borrowings and influences in his work can be traced to artists as diverse as [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Raphael]], [[Hercules Seghers]], and [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]].\\n\\nDrawings by Rembrandt and [[list of Rembrandt pupils|his pupils/followers]] have been extensively studied by many artists and scholars{{efn|Such as [[Otto Benesch]],<ref>Benesch, Otto: \\'\\'The Drawings of Rembrandt: First Complete Edition in Six Volumes\\'\\'.

Oil on canvas; on display at the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Rijksmuseum]], Amsterdam]]\\n\\nRembrandt painted the large painting \\'\\'The Militia Company of Captain Frans Banning Cocq\\'\\' between 1640 and 1642. This picture was called \\'\\'De Nachtwacht\\'\\' by the Dutch and \\'\\'The Night Watch\\'\\' by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]] because by the 18th century the picture was so dimmed and defaced that it was almost indistinguishable, and it looked quite like a night scene. After it was cleaned, it was discovered to represent broad day—a party of [[musketeer]]s stepping from a gloomy courtyard into the blinding sunlight.\\n\\nThe piece was commissioned for the new hall of the \\'\\'[[Kloveniersdoelen, Amsterdam|Kloveniersdoelen]]\\'\\', the musketeer branch of the civic militia. Rembrandt departed from convention, which ordered that such genre pieces should be stately and formal, rather a line-up than an action scene. Instead he showed the militia readying themselves to embark on a mission (what kind of mission, an ordinary patrol or some special event, is a matter of debate).\\n\\nContrary to what is often said, the work was hailed as a success from the beginning. Parts of the canvas were cut off (approximately 20% from the left hand side was removed) to make the painting fit its new position when it was moved to [[Royal Palace of Amsterdam|Amsterdam town hall]] in 1715; the Rijksmuseum has a smaller copy of what is thought to be the full original composition; the four figures in the front are at the centre of the canvas. The painting is now in the [[Rijksmuseum]].\\n\\n==Expert assessments==\\n{{see also|Rembrandt catalog raisonné, 1968}}\\n[[File:Rembrandt - De Poolse ruiter, c.1655 (Frick Collection).jpg|thumb|left|\\'\\'[[The Polish Rider]]\\'\\' – Possibly a [[Lisowczycy|Lisowczyk]] on horseback]]\\nIn 1968 the Rembrandt Research Project began under the sponsorship of the Netherlands Organization for the Advancement of Scientific Research; it was initially expected to last a highly optimistic ten years. Art historians teamed up with experts from other fields to reassess the authenticity of works attributed to Rembrandt, using all methods available, including state-of-the-art technical diagnostics, and to compile a complete new [[catalogue raisonné]] of his paintings. As a result of their findings, many paintings that were previously attributed to Rembrandt have been removed from their list, although others have been added back.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Rembrandt Research Project: Past, Present, Future |url=http://www.paintyourlife.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Preface.pdf |access-date=11 August 2014}}</ref> Many of those removed are now thought to be the work of his students.\\n\\nOne example of activity is \\'\\'[[The Polish Rider]]\\'\\', in New York\\'s [[Frick Collection]]. Rembrandt\\'s authorship had been questioned by at least one scholar, Alfred von Wurzbach, at the beginning of the twentieth century, but for many decades later most scholars, including the foremost authority writing in English, [[Julius S. Held]], agreed that it was indeed by the master. In the 1980s, however, Dr.&nbsp;Josua Bruyn of the Foundation Rembrandt Research Project cautiously and tentatively attributed the painting to one of Rembrandt\\'s closest and most talented pupils, [[Willem Drost]], about whom little is known. But Bruyn\\'s remained a minority opinion, the suggestion of Drost\\'s authorship is now generally rejected, and the Frick itself never changed its own attribution, the label still reading \"Rembrandt\" and not \"attributed to\" or \"school of\". More recent opinion has shifted even more decisively in favor of the Frick, with [[Simon Schama]] (in his 1999 book \\'\\'Rembrandt\\'s Eyes\\'\\') and the Rembrandt Project scholar Ernst van de Wetering (Melbourne Symposium, 1997) both arguing for attribution to the master. Those few scholars who still question Rembrandt\\'s authorship feel that the execution is uneven, and favour different attributions for different parts of the work.<ref>See \"Further Battles for the \\'Lisowczyk\\' (Polish Rider) by Rembrandt\" Zdzislaw Zygulski, Jr., \\'\\'Artibus et Historiae\\'\\', Vol. 21, No. 41 (2000), pp. 197–205.

Critical opinion of this picture has varied since 1905, when Wilhelm von Bode described it as \"a somewhat abnormal work\" by Rembrandt.

Additionally, his style proved easy enough for his most talented students to emulate. Further complicating matters is the uneven quality of some of Rembrandt\\'s own work, and his frequent stylistic evolutions and experiments.<ref>\"...Rembrandt was not always the perfectly consistent, logical Dutchman he was originally anticipated to be.\" Ackley, p. 13.</ref> As well, there were later imitations of his work, and restorations which so seriously damaged the original works that they are no longer recognizable.<ref>van de Wetering, p. x.</ref> It is highly likely that there will never be universal agreement as to what does and what does not constitute a genuine Rembrandt.\\n\\n==Painting materials==\\n[[File:Rembrandt - Saskia van Uylenburgh in Arcadian Costume - WGA19164.jpg|thumb|\\'\\'Saskia as Flora\\'\\', 1635]]\\n\\nTechnical investigation of Rembrandt\\'s paintings in the possession of the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]]<ref>Kühn, Hermann. \\'Untersuchungen zu den Pigmenten und Malgründen Rembrandts, durchgeführt an den Gemälden der Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden\\'(Examination of pigments and grounds used by Rembrandt, analysis carried out on paintings in the Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Dresden), Maltechnik/Restauro, issue 4 (1977): 223–233</ref> and in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister (Kassel)]]<ref>Kühn, Hermann. \\'Untersuchungen zu den Pigmenten und Malgründen Rembrandts, durchgeführt an den Gemälden der Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Kassel\\' (Examination of pigments and grounds used by Rembrandt, analysis carried out on paintings in the Staatlichen Kunstsammlungen Kassel), Maltechnik/Restauro, volume 82 (1976): 25–33</ref> was conducted by Hermann Kühn in 1977.

In 1632, he used this monogram early in the year, then added his family name to it, \"RHL-van Rijn\", but replaced this form in that same year and began using his first name alone with its original spelling, \"Rembrant\". In 1633 he added&nbsp;a&nbsp;\"d\", and maintained this form consistently from then on, proving that this minor change had a meaning for him (whatever it might have been). This change is purely visual; it does not change the way his name is pronounced. Curiously enough, despite the large number of paintings and etchings signed with this modified first name, most of the documents that mentioned him during his lifetime retained the original \"Rembrant\" spelling. (Note: the rough chronology of signature forms above applies to the paintings, and to a lesser degree to the etchings; from 1632, presumably, there is only one etching signed \"RHL-v. Rijn,\" the large-format \"Raising of Lazarus,\"&nbsp;B&nbsp;73).<ref>[http://www.rembrandt-signature-file.com/remp_texte/remp050.pdf Chronology of his signatures (pdf)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171107/http://www.rembrandt-signature-file.com/remp_texte/remp050.pdf |date=3 March 2016 }} with examples.

This is the condition of a Dutch bourgeois man. We could say the same thing for the other genius of that age, Rembrandt van Rijn.

In his home city of Leiden and in Amsterdam, where he worked for nearly forty years, he mentored generations of other painters and produced a body of work that has never ceased to attract admiration, critique, and interpretation. (...) Rembrandt\\'s art is a key component in any study of the Dutch Golden Age, and his membership in the canon of artistic genius is well established, but he is also a figure whose significance transcends specialist interest. Literary critics have pondered \"Rembrandt\" as a \"cultural text\"; novelists, playwrights, and filmmakers have romanticized his life, and in popular culture, his name has become synonymous with excellence for products and services, ranging from [[Rembrandt toothpaste|toothpaste]] to self-help advice.<ref name=\"FranitsAshgate2016\">Franits, Wayne (ed.): \\'\\'The Ashgate Research Companion to Dutch Art of the Seventeenth Century\\'\\'.

The great shadow of the old master required a decided attitude. A late [[Romantic painting|Romantic painter]] and critic, like [[Eugène Fromentin|Fromentin]] was, if he happened not to like some of Rembrandt\\'s pictures, he felt obliged to justify his feeling. The greatness of the dramatic old master was for artists of about 1875 not a matter for doubt. \\'Either I am wrong\\', Fromentin wrote from Holland \\'or everybody else is wrong\\'. When Fromentin realized his inability to like some of the works by Rembrandt he formulated the following comments: \\'I even do not dare to write down such a blasphemy; I would get ridiculed if this is disclosed\\'. Only about twenty-five years earlier another French Romantic master [[Eugène Delacroix]], when expressing his admiration for Rembrandt, has written in his \\'\\'Journal\\'\\' a very different statement: \\'... perhaps one day we will discover that Rembrandt is a much greater painter than [[Raphael]]. It is a blasphemy which would make hair raise on the heads of all the academic painters\\'. In 1851 the blasphemy was to put Rembrandt above Raphael. In 1875 the blasphemy was not to admire everything Rembrandt had ever produced.
